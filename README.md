## Overview 
  This Modal component i created was inspired from a ReactJS challenge i joined in couple of weeks back 

## My Process 
  All of it was built using ReactJS 
    ### What i learned 
    - I learnt how to make use of a function inside another component while making use of Props
    - I also learnt how to use React hook to change the state of a function
